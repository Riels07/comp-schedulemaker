COMP,150,1,Introduction to Computing,"Harrington,Andrew N",LSC,LSC,1,T,2:30:00 PM,4:00:00 PM,"This class has run successfully both face to face and online, with the same content. This blended format takes advantage of face-to-face in initially getting to know each other, getting the class going, finding partners, and getting direct help with any online technology. Later, since the class is flipped, and most all interaction is help on your individual computer work, help can come online, either in part of regular class time or at varied times convenient to you and the instructor. We will use software to share screens online. A quiet place is important for online help, with a computer that you have access to having a good Internet speed and with the ability to talk and listen online.
